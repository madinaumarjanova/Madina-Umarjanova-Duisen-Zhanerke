   <h3>Definition</h3>
    <p>Barsakelmes is a former island in the Aral Sea, now a tract in the Aral district of the Kyzylorda region of Kazakhstan. Translated from Kazakh, it means "if he goes— he will not return." It is located 180 km southwest of the city of Aralsk. The climate is sharply continental, dry.  The average air temperature in July is +26 °C. In the summer of 2009, due to the drying up of the eastern part of the Greater Aral Sea, Barsakelmes as a peninsula ceased to exist. It was later restored in 2010, disappeared again in 2014, and has been a peninsula since 2015 to the present. Its coastline fluctuates, it reached the largest values in the full-water 2017 and 2020.</p>

<p>The state Barsakelmessky Nature Reserve is located on the territory of the tract.</p>

    <h3>Legends and myths</h3>
    <p>According to popular rumor, in the 20s of the XIX century, a whole topographic expedition disappeared in Barsakelmes. Her search took three months. However, at one point, the disappeared people themselves unexpectedly showed up at their homes. When asked where they disappeared all the time, all as one stated that they had been on the island for only 3 days, I am engaged in topographic survey. A similar case occurred with prisoners who escaped from prisons, who hid here from search groups. A few years later, the fugitives returned to their families. Upon returning home, they were horrified to discover that years, not months, had passed since their escape. There are a lot of such intriguing stories with "temporary" failures. Ufologists have their own version on this score. In their opinion, the island of Barsakelmes is under the influence of a powerful geoactive zone. Hence, anomalous phenomena, such as a violation of the course of physical time, follow.</p>
    <p>Another more plausible story of swallowing people by the island says that in the 60s, a Soviet expedition delivered a tank stuffed with reconnaissance equipment to the island. And the tanker was instructed to be on the line all the time. The tankman carried out the order unconditionally and talked on the radio for a long time. But at some point the broadcast stopped. The tanker did not get in touch anymore. When the rest of the expedition members arrived at the tank, there was no one inside, and the military transport itself was covered with frost. It is still not clear where the tanker went. </p>

  <div class="main">
    <h3>Definition</h3>
    <p>The valley of balls is located in the Torysh tract of the Mangystau region. The whole valley is literally covered with stone balls of various sizes and shades, the origin of which is still unknown. For more than 250 years, scientists have been puzzling over this mystery, but they cannot come to certain conclusions yet. According to one version, the balls originated in ancient times in warm reservoirs, when there were favorable conditions for the reproduction of plankton. Silted-up clusters of small organisms became the core of these balls, which grew on the principle of a snowball. When the waters receded, the bizarre round blocks appeared on land.</p>

<p>The state Barsakelmessky Nature Reserve is located on the territory of the tract.</p>

    <h3>Legends and myths</h3>
    <p>According to one of the local legends, hordes of enemies came to the Mangistau land, like locusts, covering the ground. The locals stretched out their hands to heaven in prayer for help and were heard. The heavens opened with torrential torrents, thunder and lightning. In an instant, all the enemies turned into stones.</p>

<p> This is how endless fields and ridges of unusual stone formations – spherical nodules appeared on Mangistau. Geologists have no clear opinion about the process that created them. In geology, it is considered that as many researchers of nodules, there are as many opinions on the nature of their origin.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="main">
    <h3>Definition</h3>
    <p>Kyzylkum is a sandy and rocky desert between the rivers of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya, in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. It is bounded in the northwest by the Aral Sea, in the northeast by the Syr Darya, in the east by the spurs of the Tien Shan and Pamir-Alai, in the southwest by the Amu Darya. The area is about 300 thousand km2.Kyzylkum - one of the greatest deserts of Eurasia - stretches from the coast of the Aral Sea in the north to a relatively narrow fertile oasis strip near the Zaravshan River in the south. This huge territory with an area of 300 thousand square kilometers is bounded from the east and from the west by the great Central Asian rivers Syr Darya and Amu Darya. Kyzylkums occupy most of the Navoi region.</p>

<p> Kyzylkums have many faces. Here, endless expanses of loose sands with mounds of dunes with bushes of saxaul and camel thorn are replaced by clay plains with hills of hummocks. There are places here with takyrs as smooth and even as parquet, hard as concrete. There are rocky, albeit low mountains, mineral springs, groves of saxaul, outcrops of indigenous rocks of ages of a billion or more years. There are both current and former lakes. The hottest and driest place in Uzbekistan is located in Kyzylkums. The annual precipitation does not reach 70 mm here . In the summer, the Kyzylkums receive so much solar heat that they are heated beyond all limits. It is not by chance that this desert is called the Red Sands.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="main">
    <h3>Legends and myths</h3>
    <p>There are a number of unexplored anomalous sites in the Kyzylkums. For example, in the Central Kyzylkums, in the mountains, unusual rock carvings were found. Some of them depict people in spacesuits, others - the likeness of spaceships.In Kyzylkums, "ordinary" UFO sightings are not uncommon. In November 1990, employees of the Zarafshan cooperative "Ice", driver Alexander Manasov, car mechanic Gennady Agafonov and freight forwarder Tamara Timakovich, saw a long cylindrical object about forty meters high on the Navoi-Zarafshan road at night. A powerful, focused, cone-shaped beam with very clear boundaries beat from an invisible source.The results of the analysis showed the presence of a substance of unearthly origin .However, this story has never been officially confirmed.</p>

  <div class="main">
    <h3>Legends and myths</h3>
    <p>Legend has it that in ancient times there lived a large white camel Bura in these places. The sacred animal was distinguished by strength and beauty. His homeland was the forests of Mount Kokshetau, but every afternoon he went down to the Silver Lake to drink water. The locals treated the camel with respect, because it protected their lives. Bura felt the approach of strangers and notified people about it with a loud shout. Therefore, for many years the inhabitants of the region lived in freedom and peace.
    One day robbers appeared in these places, who robbed and killed people, animals, birds. Bura warned everyone about their approach by shouting loudly. This helped save many innocent lives, but the robbers realized who was the cause of their failures. They set a trap for the camel when he once again went down to drink water. The leader of the robbers shot the animal in the chest. The arrow came out through one of the humps of the Drill. Sensing the approach of death, the sacred animal descended to the lake, where it petrified.
    In honor of the noble camel, these places began to be called Burabai. Silver lake with the purest water was named Borovoe. According to legend, the frozen camel remained forever in its native places, turning into a mountain whose height is almost 600 m. Locals see in it the outlines of a petrified animal, from the hump of which a deadly arrow sticks out.</p>
    <p>In Borovoye, many legends are associated with natural attractions. So, there are many folk tales about the Okzhetpes rock. Its name translates from the local as "the arrow will not reach". One of the most popular legends about the rock is the following.
    Many centuries ago, a formidable khan lived in these parts, who was famous for his victories. From the next campaign, he came with a large number of trophies, among which was a young Kalmyk captive. The khan divided the spoils among his people, but could not decide who would get the girl as a wife. Then he allowed the Kalmyk woman to choose her own groom.
    The girl climbed to the top of the cliff and hung her handkerchief there. She asked the khan to give her for the warrior whose arrow would reach him. Many horsemen participated in the competition, but no one coped with the task. Then Khan got angry and ordered the girl to come down. But the young Kalmyk woman chose freedom, so she rushed down from the top of the hill into the blue waters of Lake Auliekol.Legend has it that the rock Zhumbaktas appeared at the place of the girl's fall after a while. She reminds the locals of the one who chose freedom, honor and dignity at the cost of her own life. </p>
